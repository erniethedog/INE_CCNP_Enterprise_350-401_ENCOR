Rapid Spanning-Tree Protocol & MST

802.1w - rstp
802.1D-2004 - current RSTP standard

802.1s - MST


RSTP BPDUs - NEW FORMAT and HANDLING
What Makes RSTP rapid?
New RSTP Topology Change Process

REMEBER STP RULE: Switch can only have one DP going towards a single collision domain 

New Port Roles
- Alternate
  > port received a BPDU from another switch
- Backup
  > port received a BPDU from itself
- Edge
  > For port fast
  > when a switch received a BPDU on a port fast interface, SW will disbale port fast on that interface (even if it is configured on show run)


NEW BPDU FORMAT
- Protocol version 2 (was 0 for legacy) for RSTP
- No more TCN frames
  > A different frame is now sent instead of the TCN
- Flag field changes
  > All flag fields have meaning on RSTP. On legacy, only bits 0 and 7 have values. This is how switch tells if peer is running legacy or rstp
  > 802.1D bridges drop RSTP BPDUs

NEW BPDU HANDLING
- on legacy, Root Bridge generates and sends BPDU and send this out to other switches
- receiving switches will process the received BPDU (add cost, change bridge ID to their own BID, change port names, etc) then send this out downstream
- basically, on 802.1d (legacy), BPDUs are only forwarded, after being received on the Root Port
- No BPDU received? Nothing to forward downstream
- Upstream switch is declared dead after Max-Age. TCN is now sent

- on 802.1w
- BPDUs are generate every Hello interval (default 2s) on DP regardless of frequency of BPDUs received on root port
- upstream switch is declared dead after 3x Hello interval
- IF 3x Hello interval is longer that Max-Age, Max-Age will be used to declare a switch is dead
  > show spanning-tree

==================================================================
RSTP Synchronization Process

Proposal and Agreements (CAN ONLY BE USED FOR P2P; CANNOT BE USED ON SHARED INTERFACES)
- Bidirectional BDPU transmission with "proposal" bit set (I want to be the Root Bridge)
- BPDU transmission with 'agreement' bit set (from SW that is going to be the root bridge)

==================================================================
RSTP Topology Changes

- TC Flag is set on the BPDU frame
- Generated when non-edge port goes FORWARDING
- "broadcasted" on the network by the initiator (not by the Root anymore like in legacy)
  > sent on all root ports
  > sent on all designated ports that are non-edge
- Flush most of the CAM entries in the network IMMEDIATELY
  > Edge ports are not flushed
  > MACs on ports receiving Topology Change BPDU are not flushed
  > More flooding but restore connectivity immediately

==================================================================
Multiple Spanning-Tree Protocol

 - SAME on previous notes

==================================================================
MST Regions & BPDU Details

- MST defines a Region as bridges that agree upon
  > Region Name
  > Revision Number (does not dynamically change)
    - personal note by Keith/INE, this is like some sort of security/password in which every SW should agree
  > VLAN to STP instance mappings
  
Creating MST Region
- Following steps must be done manually on all switches that will be running MST
- VTPv3 may be used to propagate this config among switches

! global config
spanning-tree mst configuration
name [MST_NAME]

- Once you create your MST Region, Instance 0 exists by default and all VLANs are in this instance
  > No load balancing possible yet
- Set the Revision Number and bundle VLANs into MST instances

! under spanning-tree mst configuration
revision 1
instance 1 vlan 101-200   !!You can start with any instance number. All SW just have to agree on the instance number
instance 2 vlan 201-300 

- Instances you create manually are called MSTI = MST Instance
- Remember than instance O (called IST) is the default instance. IST becomes relevant for interoperation with SW NOT running MST
- Any VLANs not moved in the MSTI will remain in IST

- Enable MST Globally
  > Real deployment must start at the Root and branch out

!global config
spanning-tree mode mst



PVST and MST BPDU DIFFERENCES
- PVST
  > Each instance of STP (per VLAN) transmits its own BPDU
  > Root Bridge for network with 20 VLANs will generate 20 BPDUs on each VLAN, every hello time (2s)
- MST
  > A single BPDU is generated which contains MST information for all instances relevant to an interface
  > Size of BPDU is variable depending on how many Mrecords it contans

MRecord
- An MRecord for a given instance contains:       
  > All STP Parameters for an MSTI
    - Root BID for that instance
    - Sending BID for that instance
    - Root Cost for that instance
    - ETC ETC ETC
- MSTIs are RSTP instnaces that only exist inside the region
- They don't interact directly with other STPs outside of the region
- Only one instance has timer related parameters (the IST instance)
- Portion of the BPDU that contains data for all MSTI     


On BPDU Capture (Wireshark)
- MST is version 3
- RSTP is version 2 (version 1 is also RSTP, but it was changed to 2)
- 802.1D is version 0


MST BPDU on TRUNK PORTS
- MRecord is propagated on trunks which allow that VLAN, including Instance-0

MST BPDU on Access Ports
- Mrecord for instance-0 (IST)
- Mrecord for VLAN in which that port belongs

==================================================================
MST Path Selection & Configuration


PATH SELECTION
- Same election process as CST/PVST
- Each Instance within a Region elects:
  > Root Bridge (per instance)
    - Lowest BID wins
  > Root Port (per bridge)
    - lowest cost
    - lowest upstream BID
    - lowest upstream port ID
  > Root port selection within MST region for IST dependeng on location of IST Master

Long Path Cost
- 802.1t defines new default 32 bit costs based on port bandwidth
  > spanning-tree pathcost method [long|short]  !under global config. long = 32 bits; short = 16 bits
- 802.1s MST uses these new values (by default)

BW (Mbps)     New Value       Orig Value
10            2 000 000           100
100           200 000             19
1000           20 000              4
10 000          2 000              2

Chaning MST Root Bridge Election
- Manually change BID priority
  > spanning-tree mst [instance] priority
  > lower is better
- Use root bridge macro
  > spanning-tree mst [instance] root [primary|secondary]
  > sets local priority based on current Root Bridge
- Verification
  > show spanning-tree mst [instance]
  > show spanning-tree root

Changing an MST Port's Role
- Modify the port's cost
  > spanning-tree mst [instance] cost
  > bandwidth [bps]   !interface level
- Modify the Bridge ID
  > spanning-tree [instance] priority
-Modify the Port ID
  > spanning-tree mst [instance] port-priority
- Verification
  > show spanning-tree interface [int] detail
  > show spanning-tree mst [instance] detail

==================================================================
MST Boundary Ports

INTRA vs INTER REGION

- Intra Region
  > Details of the region are known within the region
  > VLAN to MSTIs are manually defined
  > Undefined VLANs fall into CIST (MST 0)
  
- Inter Region
  > Details between regions are NOT known (one detail is not matching)
  > Different regions see each other as virtual bridges
  > Intra-region MSTIs are collapsed into CIST
    - Even if no VLANs are assigned in Instance-0, the instance will always be there.
    - Instance-0 is only way Spanning tree can talk outside of its instance
    
Internal and Boundary Ports
- Internal Port is one that is connected to an MST peer
- Bounday Port = port connected to another switch that is not capable of joining our LOCAL MST Region
- A port is considered "Boundary" by MST if:
  > MST BPDUs sent/received that dont match
    - Mismatched MST Region Names
    - Mismatched MST Revision number
    - Mismatched Configuration Digest values
  > We sent out an MST BPDU, but we received a regular 802.1d (or 802.1w) BPDU
  
show spanning-tree mst 1
! Boundary ports will have "Bound (STP_VER)" under the Type category
! ie. P2P Bound(PVST)
  
- MST BPDUs cannot be transmitted on Boundary ports
- Must scale back to Rapid-PVST or PVST+ on the boundary port
- Boundary ports normally displayed via "show" commands only on Blocking and Root ports. NOT Designated Ports

TROUBLESHOOTING MST BOUNDARY PORTS
- Look at topology. Is the switch expected NOT to run MST?
- Not expected? 
  > Check MST configs on peer switches
  > Check IOS
    - STANDARD vs Pre-STANDARD MST
    
STANDARD vs Pre-STANDARD MST (not going to be on exam)
- Syslogs and "show" output indicate reception of "Pre-Standard MST"
- Cisco implemented 802.1s MST on switches while it was still in DRAFT status
- Slight changes to MST BPDY formated were implemented in the standard version causing inconsistencies
  1. Version 3 length field in pre-standard BPDU sent as 0000F
  2. Pre-Standard MST config identifier does not have the Format Selector set to 00F
  3. Pre-Standard MST config identifier digest signature keys do not comply with IEEE 802.1s
  4. Pre-Standard MRecords are not 16 bytes long

Best Options:
- Upgrade IOS
- Or go to newer switch and degrade MST to pre-standard
  > spanning-tree mst pre-standard  !!interface config
    

Full BPDU is NOT sent to boundary ports towards non-MST peers.
Only the flags, and Instance-0 information are sent


MST INTEROPERABILITY
- MST is backwards compatible with legacy CST and PVST+
- Behaves like Inter-region MST
- CST Root SHOULD BE WITHIN THE MST DOMAIN
  > Load-balancing capability is lost if Root is within the CST domain


==================================================================
MST: The Virtual-Bridge

A "VIRTUAL" BRIDGE
- Details of the MST Region and "hidden" by other regions and CST domains
- Switch outside of the region do not have visibility to:
  > Actual cumulative cost to reach IST Root Bridge (if within MST Region)
  > Bridge-IDs of non-Root Bridges

The MST Region is like a single giant switch

CIST REGIONAL ROOT
- IST elects 2 Root Bridges
  > Main Root bridge (root for entire CST and INSTANCE-0)
  > CIST Regional Root (also called IST MASTER)
- Within MST Region, all MST switches select their IST Root port based on the location of the IST MASTER

IST MASTER ELECTION
- If CST Root Bridge is elected inside MST region, then CST Root = IST Master
- If CST Root Bridge is located on non-MST switch, IST MASTER = MST Switch with the lowest cost to Root

==================================================================
IST Master & Root Port Selection

Scenario 1: MST Switch = CST Root
  - MST Root Bridge is also the IST MASTER
  - Non-Root MST bridges will send the Bridge ID to outside the MST region
    > BPDU sent with values of BID as the Root Bridge. cost = 0

Scenario 2: CST Switch = CST Root
  - MST domain will select an IST Master to get to the CST Root bridge

==================================================================
MST - PVST Simulation

- MST was designed by IEEE to be compatible with CST (802.1d and RSTP)
- Cisco modifies their implementation of MST to also be compatible with PVST
- If multiple BPDUs are received on an MST Switch interface, we must be connected to a PVST switch
- When detecting connection to PVST switch, MST switch will do the following:
  > Mark port as boundary
  > Replicate IST BPDY N-times (where "N" is quantity of VLANs carrier on that port)
  > NOTE THAT IST WILL STILL CONTROL THE PORT STATE
  
PVST Simulation: MST Root Bridge
- MST Region determines lowest Bridge ID for instance-0 among all MST switches
- Compares MST/IST Bridge-ID against PVST VLAN-1 Bridge-ID to determine "winner" (ie Root Bridge of CST)
  > MST Region has overall lowest IST Bridge-ID = Root Bridge is within MST Region (Recommended)
    - BENEFIT of having Root Bridge within MST Region = PVST Load Balancing
  > VLAN-1 within PVST has lowest overall Bridge ID = Root bridge is within PVST domain (NOT RECOMMENDED)

PVST-Inconsistent (NOT INCLUDED IN TEST)
- Instance-0 (IST) is very particular about how it interacts with PVST+
- Very easy fir IST to get 'confused' and go into the "PVST-Inconsistent" state if PVST+ is not designed in a particular way
- These are called PVST-Simulation Rules

PVST Simulation Failure
- Error Message: SPANTREE-2-PVSTSIM_FAIL
- Blocking designated port INT_NAME: Inconsistent superior PVST BPDU received on VLAN VLAN_ID, claiming root MAC_ADDRESS
- under "show spanning-tree mst"
  > Type: P2P Bound(PVST) *PVST_Inc
  > Role: Designated
  > Status: Blocking
  
To Prevent PVST-Inconsistent, the following rules must be followed:
- MST Instance 0 Bridge ID should be lower than PVST VLAN-1 Bridge ID
- Bridge ID on PVST for VLANs (2-4094) should be HIGHER than MST Instance 0, but lower than PVST VLAN-1
  > If Bridge ID for MST Instance 0 is lower than PVST VLAN-1 Bridge ID, it should be consistent for all other PVST VLANS BID
    - ie. MST Instance 0 BID should be lower than all PVST VLANs BID
  > OR Vice Versa: MST Instance 0 BID > PVST VLANs (ALL) BID
  
Dan's Notes:
The following will AVOID PVST-INCONSISTENT
- MST Instance 0 BID < PVST VLAN 1 BID < PVST all other VLAN BID
  > MST Instance 0 is the Root Bridge (Recommended)
- MST Instance 0 BID > PVST VLAN 1 BID > PVST all other VLAN BID
  > PVST VLAN 1 is the Root Bridge
