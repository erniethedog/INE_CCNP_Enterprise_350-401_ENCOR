CLASSIC EIGRP

Configuring Classic EIGRP
Verifying EIGRP Adjacencies
Verifying EIGRP Topology

Classic EIGRP 
- EIGRP prior to IOS 15.X
- AKA EIGRP Autonomous System Configuration
  > Process name is the AS number
- Administrative Distance of 90
- Well known Multicast address for EIGRP process = 224.0.0.10
- Internet Protocol 88 (own transport)
- uses Realiable Transport Protocol (RTP) - not to be confused with Real Time Protocol

BGP uses TCP under port 179
RIP uses UDP



Enabling Classic EIGRP
- Enable global process
  > router eigrp [AS]
  > AS number must match to be adjacent
- Enable the interface process
  > network [address] [wildcard]
    - no wildcard mask, it defaults to classful mask
    - This does not mean that EIGRP advertises the subnet. EIGRP is just turned ON on interface/s with that subnet
    - But if EIGRP is turned on on that interface, EIGRP advertises that interface
    - In BGP, the network statement is used to advertise the prefix
                        
  > similar to OSPF network statement

Verifying EIGRP
- Verify EIGRP
  > show ip eigrp interfaces [detail]
  > show ip protocols
- Verify EIGRP transport
  > debug eigrp packet [hello|ack|update|query|reply...]
- Verify neighbor adjacencies
  > show ip eigrp neighbors [detail]
  > Queue count should be 0 if converged. If queue count is NOT 0, neighbors are not adjacent
  > EIGRP uses multicast and unicast
  > Sequence number = increment to ack the updates. basically, peers have to agree on this seq num. part of protocol reliability
  > SRTT = Smooth Round Trip Time - one way to check if there are layer 1 issues
- Verifying  EIGRP topology
  > show ip eigrp topology [all-links]
    - By default, only the successors are show. need all-links to show the other routes
  > show ip eigrp topology [prefix/len]
  
Goes to selection process - feasibility condition
the ones who win the feasib condition become the successors
Successor are the candidates installed on the Routing Table
  
This is different to OSPF, ISIS, and BGP
Separation of information used for advertising and info to route traffic

OSPF - sync database within the are. not necessarily mean it is used for routing

For EIGRP, since EIGRP does not have a overall view of the network. They only know advertisement from directly connected neighbors
If EIGRP is learning a route, but it does not install on the routing table, it means EIGRP does not advertise the route


show ip protocols
- shows protocols running
- under EIGRP
  > NSF - non stop forwarding
  > MTR - Multiple Topology Routing - for EIGRP Named Mode
  > Routing for Networks
    - see networks in which EIGRP is running
  > Routing Information Sources
    - to check if you are receiving routes from a neighbor
    - list of neighbors that are advertising on EIGRP


Forming Neighbor adjacency is on multicast
once neighbors are adjacent, unicast is used to send updates to peers
Source IP is, of course, the router ID


show ip eigrp topology [IP] [subnet mask]
  - State = Passive. Used for forwarding. EIGRP is converged. Active = running reconvergence process
  - Feasible Distance = Metric
  - Number of Successors
  - (Feasible Distance / Advertised Distance)
    > FD - Metric the router is using
    > AD - Metric the upstream neighbor is using
    > Normally FD > AD, since router needs to consider values in calculation to get to the upstream neighbor
    > If FD < AD, EIGRP will think that there is a loop in the network


show ip route [eigrp]
- status code of D

EIGRP timers does not need to match for the protocol to work
Normally, these are set as the same, but it is not needed
There is always BFD or layer 1 link detection to check adjacencies

======================================================================
EIGRP NAMED MODE

- also called EIGRP Multi-AF (Address Family) Mode
- Better configuration heirarchy
  > old syntax is not that intuitive
  > all config now goes under global process
- better feature parity between ipv4 and ipv6
  > syntax is unified for IPv4 and IPv6 under one process
  > uses address-families to distinguish v4 and v6
- Newer feature arent supported in Classic Mode
  > Wide Metrics, IPv6 VRF Lite, etc
  
Configuration
- Enable the global process
  > router eigrp [name]
  > name is not the AS number
  > ie. router eigrp DANCEDRIC
    - Name is locally significant
- Enable the address-family
  > address-family ipv4 unicast autonomous-system 1
- Enable the interface process
  > network [address] [wildcard]
  > similiar to OSPF network statement
- Customize the interface
  > af-interface [default|int]
    - default - configuration for all interfaces

! topology base = not using multiple topology
- All interfaces are under base topology by default
- features that is global on the process goes under topology base, ie. redistribute list


MTR = Multiple Topology Routing
- like MPLS traffic engineering
- ie. different topology for voice, multicast, and video

Wide Metrics - used in Named Mode
> show ip eigrp topology [network]
  - Delay is in picoseconds
> very granular delay values to accomodate high speed links like 100GigE
> automatic on the process

Converting EIGRP Classic to Named Mode
> eigrp upgrade-cli
> Conversion is hitless 
  - performs graceful restart automatically. neighbor will say the it needs to restart adjacency
  - adjacencies will flap but data plane will still work
  - Graceful restart = Non-stop forwarding = non-stop routing
    > NSF / NSR = cisco proprietary term
    > graceful restart = standard term
> supports both IPv4 and IPv6 EIGRP
  - can be in different AS

EIGRP CLASSIC METRIC CALCULATION


- EIGRP Classic Metric Calculation
  > lowest composite metric based on
    - Bandwidth
      > Inverse lowest bandwidth along path in Kbps scaled by (10^7 * 256)
        - ie. BW is 1000000 Kbps
        - (10^7 * 256) / 1000000
        - BW = 2560
    - Delay
      > Cumulative delay along path in tens of microseconds (us) scaled by 256
        - ie. Delay is 5010 microseconds
        - Delay = 501 * 256 = 128256
    - Load
      > highest load along path
    - Reliability
      > lowest reliability along path
  > normally, only BW and Delay are used, since Load and Reliabiity change over time
  > Composite metric is computed as 
    - metric = [k1 * BW +(k2 * BW)/(256 - load) + k3 * delay]
    - if k5 != 0, metric = metric * [k5/(reliability + k4)]
  > K values allow for manual weighting
    - defaults are K1 = 1, K2 = 0, K3 = 1, K4 = 0, K5 = 0
    - implies default composite is (BW + delay)
  > can be modified with "metric weights" command
    - must match for adjacency to establish


Note that BW value on the link is also used on other applications, like QoS or calculations by neighboring routers
  - BW is used on a per prefix (routers connected to the same switch under one subnet)
So, Delay is generally modified for traffic engineering (if you want to chose one path over the other)
  - Delay is cumulative on a hop by hop basis

Command:
metric weights [TOS] [k1] [k2] [k3] [k4] [k5]
!k6 - used in named mode
metric weights 0 0 0 1 0 0
!changing K1 value to 0

Note:
In IGP, you change link attribute, route is affected
In BGP, attribute is owned by the route, not by the link
