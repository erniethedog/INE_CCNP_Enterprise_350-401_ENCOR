Core BGP Routing


BASIC BGP WORKFLOW
- Establish TCP transport
- Establish BGP Peerings
- Negotiate Address Families
- Advertise NLRI
- Apply BGP Policy


ESTABLISHING TCP TRANSPORT
- Unlike IGP, BGP does not use its own transport
  > Uses TCP Port 179
- Typically implies either
  > Peers are directly connected
  > IGP transport is already established
  > Label Switched Path (LSP) is already established
- TTL is a transport consideration
  > iBGP = TTL is 225
  > EBGP = TTL is 1 by default
  > Multihop EBGP


Note: MPLS tunnel uses the loopback interface as source and destination IP address
  > So make sure to have LSP between loopbacks
  > Check both ipv4 and ipv6


ESTABLISHING BGP PEERINGS
- BGP must agree upon
  > AS numbers
    - Global, local, private, confed sub-as, etc
  > Update Source
    - Loopback is MPLS tunnel destination
  > Address Families
    - IPv4 Unicast, VPNv4 Unicast (MPLS L3 VPN), etc
  > Misc.
    - Authentication, TTL Security, etc
 
 
NEGOTIATING ADDRESS FAMILIES
- BGP transport is independent of NLRI
  > IPv4 transport can be used to advertise IPv6 NLRI
- Address Family Identifiers/Sub-Address Family Identifiers which NLRI is exchanged
  > IPv4 unicast, VPNv4 Unicast, VPLS, etc
- In IOS, IPv4 unicast is default
  > Can be disabled globally or per-neighbor
- In IOS XR, AFI/SAFIs must be explicitly defined
