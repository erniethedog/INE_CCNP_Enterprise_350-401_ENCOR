Enterprise & Campus LAN Switching Fundamentals

============================================================================
1. MAC Address-Table & Switching Basics

- Every switch has a MAC Address table
- Beginning of Frame is Preamble 7 bytes
- 1 byte SOF
- 6 bytes Destination MAC Address; 6 bytes Source MAC Address
- 2 bytes Length Identification
- Data/payload 46 to 1500 bytes
- 4 bytes FCS

MAC Address Learning Process
- MAC Address Table is a piece/chunk in memory
- When host send its FIRST Ethernet frame, the switch will build an entry in the table for that address.
- SOURCE MAC, SWITCH PORT where it learned MAC, VLAN

//CMD: show mac address-table

Types of Entries
- Static
- Dynamic

- Inactivity Timer / MAC Aging Timer. Default value = 300s (5 mins)
- When host sends a frame, Inactivity Timer resets
- When no frames are received on switch after the timer, switch drops the MAC entry
- When interface goes down, MAC entry is deleted on table

2 Types of Static Entries
- MAC Addresses loaded by switch upon bootup. You can see a CPU tag on those on the show command
- MAC statically/manually input by switch admin/user

//CMD: show mac address-table <dynamic> <address|value>
//CMD: show mac address-table count
//CMD: switch(config)#mac address-table aging time <secs>
Generally, do not change aging timer

//CMD: switch(config)#mac address-table static <MAC> vlan <id> interface <type/number>
Statically configure a MAC
This is usually the the very bottom the config (show run)


How to Determine Where to Send Frames (or DISCARD)
- Switch compares MAC address to ALL entries on its mac table
- For MAC with 2 entries, switch sends frame to port on static entry (like prioritization on static routes)
- If frame is not learned, switch will flood it to all ports on same vlan, except on the port where the frame was received
- Switch may also discard frame [//CMD: switch(config)#mac address-table static <MAC> vlan <id> drop]
- Switch will discard frame when destination port is also where the switch learned the mac address
- Discard frame when frames are runts or giants or with FCS error
- Discard based on access list or any security reasons decided by switch
